            <h4>Imagine this 💭</h4>
            <p>You’ve just watched The Inconvenient Truth. It's 7pm on a Friday night - and you’re sitting on the IKEA bed you’ve proudly built yourself, with the blanket your nan knitted for you draped between your legs 😌</p> 
            
            <p>On one side, you have your Tesco’s Finest veggie pizza and a glass of red wine (because you’re bougie, of course) 🍷 On the other is your Macbook Pro, streaming the credits of what was the greatest documentary of all time.</p>
            
            <p>It might look like one of the dullest Friday nights to ever exist. But it isn’t - not for you anyway.  Today wasn’t just any ordinary Friday Netflix binge. Because the fact is - you’re inspired 🤯 - and you want to do something about it. </p> 
            
            <p>Suddenly, what was a Netflix binge became a frantic Youtube search along the lines of ‘how to stop climate change.’ Then boom - your friend Sophie texts you telling her to come meet her at that new cocktail bar in Clapham 🍸 You’re keen to join - but don’t want to drop that feeling that you have to act now.</p>
            
            <p>What do you do? 🤔</p> 

            <h4>*Clears throat* we got you. Introducing...the GREEN Power 🍃</h4>

            <p>We all have different priorities in the way we travel 🚝. One day you’re ready to live the London tourist life, and other days, you tell your friends you’re ‘almost there’ when you’ve really just said goodbye to your flatmate, Jaime 😅</p>

             <p>We’ve covered different <b>Routing Powers 💪</b> like the fastest and cheapest routes. But as usual - we got more up our sleeves 😏 Our latest power, the <b>GREEN </b> Power, will get you thinking about how eco-friendly your travel really is.</p>

            <h4>Here’s how it works 🤝</h4>
                <p> 🍃 On the bottom of the screen, choose <b>GREEN</b> as your Routing Power 💪</li>
                <p><img src="/citymapper portrait/1.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block" id="screengrabs"></p>
                <p> 🍃 Write down where you want to go and tap <b>‘search’.</b></p>
                <p><img src="/citymapper portrait/2.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block" id="screengrabs"></p>
                <p> 🍃 You’ll see all possible routes, ranked by how much <b>CO<sub>2</sub> </b> each route omits.</p>
                <p><img src="/citymapper portrait/3.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block" id="screengrabs"></p>
                <p> 🍃We also show how <b>fast</b> each route takes - for a more holistic view.</p>
                <p><img src="/citymapper portrait/4.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block" id="screengrabs"></p>
                <p> 🍃 Tap on the route that works for you and <i>voila!</i><b> You’ve just done your bit to save the planet.</b></p>
                <p><img src="/citymapper portrait/5.png" alt="" class="mx-auto d-block" id="screengrabs"></p>
    

            <p>At the end of the day - maybe we can justify paying TfL £2.40 for the tube (P.S. it's better for the planet compared to taking two buses). A tad annoying but hey, the planet is dying - and we’re just glad you’re doing your bit 💚 </p>

            <h4>We make transport work for you.</h4>

            <p>Whether you’re in a rush to catch Love Island on the telly, or can’t be bothered to transfer from the Piccadilly to the District line - transport looks different for everyone 🤷‍♂️ So - it’s only right to have different choices that reflect our mood 😱</p>
